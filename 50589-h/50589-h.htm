<p class='pindent'>The results of research conducted by the Anthropological staff of the Museum,
unless otherwise provided for, are published in a series of octavo volumes of about
350 pages each, issued in parts at irregular intervals, entitled Anthropological Papers
of the American Museum of Natural History. The Anthropological work of the
Museum is organized under two heads. The Department of Ethnology exercises
curatorial functions in ethnography, ethnology and physical anthropology and in
all archæology except that pertaining to the present confines of Mexico and the
Central American States which has been delegated to a distinct department entitled
the Department of Archæology. This series of publications aims to give the results
of field-work conducted by the above departments, supplemented by the study of
collections in the Museum. The editorial responsibilities are administered by the
Curator of the Department of Ethnology.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch1'>INTRODUCTION.</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The decorative art of the Dakota has been treated in a preceding paper,
in which brief mention was made of religious art, or that art in which there
was a definite, unmistakable motive on the part of the artist to represent
mythical or philosophical ideas. In this more serious art, a large number
of designs may be characterized as “protective designs,” because their
presence or possession is in part a protection. The idea in a protective
design seems to be a symbolical appeal to the source or concrete manifestation
of a protective power. It is not easy to get the point of view and
the spirit of the faith that make these designs significant, but from the
detailed explanations of them some general idea can be formed. The
descriptions given in this paper are based upon the statements of Indians,
in most cases the executers of the designs. The attitude of the reader
toward such a study as this is often that of concluding that the points of
view set forth by a writer are universal in the tribe. This leads to a great
deal of superficial criticism. In the opinion of the writer, any rejection
of such study because one or two or several Indians deny all knowledge of
some or all of the specific native accounts upon which conclusions are
based, is absurd. We might as well test the artistic sense of a city by calling
in one or two persons from the street. As a case in point, the reader
is referred to the remarks of J. Owen Dorsey on the authenticity of Bushotter’s
Double Woman.<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a> A great deal of the information received from
Indians relative to religion is largely individual, and every ethnological
field-worker must take the best of his material from the brightest men of
a tribe. The object of this study has been to bring together ideas expressed
by various individuals more or less eminent among their people, because
all of these individual conceptions seem to have much in common. The
data were secured by the writer when on Museum expeditions to the Teton
and Yankton divisions of the Dakota.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak' id='ch2'>SHIELD-DESIGNS.</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The circular shield was distributed over a large part of North America.
A conspicuous part of the arms of Mexican warriors was “the round, small
‘target’ worn by the ‘brave’ on his left arm, and made of canes netted
together and interwoven with cotton ‘twofold,’ covered on the outside with
gilded boards and with feathers, and so strong that a hard cross-bow shot
could alone penetrate them;”<a id='r2'/><a href='#f2' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a> but “merely ornamental shields [were
also] used and carried by warriors and chiefs on festive occasions only.”<a id='r3'/><a href='#f3' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>According to the same author, in Pre-Columbian times some of the
Pueblo Indians used a thick disk of buffalo-hide as a shield. On the
Plains, from the Rio Grande to the Saskatchewan, the circular shield of
buffalo-hide was, until the extinction of the buffalo, a part of the regalia
of every warrior. These shields usually bore symbolic designs. In many
cases the designs were painted upon the rawhide itself, and protected by
a buckskin cover; while in other cases the designs were painted upon
the cover. Practically no shields of buffalo-hide are to be found in the
hands of the surviving Dakota; but in social and religious ceremonies,
models or shield-covers of buckskin or cloth, upon which are painted the
designs formerly placed on shields, are often used. For purposes of study
the writer secured such models of shields, with explanations of the designs
and with other shield-lore, from persons who formerly owned buffalo-hide
shields.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the enemies of the Dakota were armed with native weapons,
the shield had some value in itself, because few arrows could get through
it, and it was of sufficient strength to ward off a blow from a club or an
axe; but even at that time the designs and medicine objects tied to the
shield seem to have been regarded as of greater importance than the mechanical
properties of the shield itself. It was the power represented by
the design to which the owner of the shield looked for protection. Naturally,
with the introduction of fire-arms, shields ceased to have a real
protective value; but their designs were still looked upon as capable of
affording protection against evil. According to the statements of some old
men who still have faith in protective designs, the ancient shield manifested
its power upon the mind of the enemy by influencing them to shoot
at the shield rather than at the exposed parts of the body of its bearer.
But when fire-arms were introduced, experience demonstrated that the
shield was no longer a desirable object in battle, because the same influence
that drew arrows to it drew bullets also, and in this case with fatal results.
From this they concluded that guns represented a mystic power superior
to that of shield-designs, but that the latter were still efficacious, except
where so overpowered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This explanation is interesting, because these men seem to have grasped
the idea that the shield, being a conspicuous object, would attract the
attention and thus the aim of the enemy; but they confused this psychological
explanation of the observed facts with a mystic conception that the
magic power of the design upon the shield was the cause or force that
reached out and lay hold of the attention of the enemy. Yet the introduction
of fire-arms did not relegate the shield to oblivion; and shield-designs
are still cherished by men of the olden time, because they represent a kind
of individual totem or protective power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following descriptions of shield-designs are given with the interpretations
of their owners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A shield-cover decorated with feathers, bearing a design used by a chief
on ceremonial occasions, and said by him to be the copy of a shield carried
in his youth, is shown in <a href='#plate5'>Plate <span class='sc'>v</span></a>. The black border on top of the shield
takes the form of the new moon, which it represents. In the centre of the
shield is a well executed drawing of an Indian on horseback. The horse is
in blue, with zigzag black lines extending down the legs. The blue color of
the horse indicates his connection with the thunder, or the powers of the sky.
The background of the shield is in yellow, but the lower part has been
worked over with green. Symmetrically arranged around the mounted
figure are four circles of purplish color, representing a phenomenon observed
in the sky, which seems to have been either the halo of the sun, or the phenomenon
that passes under the name of “sun-dogs.” From the description
of the owner of the shield, it appears that these four circles were associated
in his mind with the medicine-hoop. He stated that this design as a whole
was the representation of what he saw in a dream; that the moon with its
dark color was drawn to represent the night, because that was the time
when he had this experience; and that in the dream he saw a horse and
rider appear in the sky surrounded by the four circular objects, as indicated
upon the shield. It appears from his explanation, that the association of
the rings with the medicine-hoop was his own individual interpretation of
the significance of his dream. In the dream he could see a shield associated
with these objects as they would appear in reality; but in the design he
attempted to convey an idea of what he saw in conformity with the conventional
modes of representative art practised by his tribe.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Another shield-cover (Fig. 1) bears a bird-design, representing to the
owner the osprey (?). One half of the background of this shield is in yellow;
the other half, in light green.<a id='r4'/><a href='#f4' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[4]</span></sup></a> These two colors represent the appearance
of the sky at sunrise; the yellow corresponding to the region of the
dawn, and the green to the dark sky above. The four stars symmetrically
arranged are colored black for the night, yellow for the dawn, blue for the
evening, and red for the day; or in other words the whole circle is represented.
The design of the bird presents some interesting details. The
lightning-symbols represent the death-dealing power conferred upon the
owner of such a shield-design at the time of his dream. The red marks
upon the breast of the bird, representing the national emblem of the United
States, were interpreted by the owner as symbolizing such death-dealing
power in contending with soldiers. The peculiar feature upon the tail
of the bird represents an additional experience, and was added to the shield
about the year 1867, after a successful engagement with the United States
troops, in which the owner of the shield participated. According to his
account, the design on the tail of the bird is the conventional symbol of the
spider-web, but is used here to represent an experience preceding the above
engagement. As the war-party were moving forward, they saw a strange
appearance in the sky, which took the form of this symbol. The sight of
it caused the war-party to scatter; and the interpretation placed upon this
by the owner was, that its manifestation of supernatural power, which was
to be conveyed to them, would cause their enemies to scatter in like confusion.
During the confusion into which the party fell, the stars moved
rapidly through the sky and the lightning
flashed in all directions. This is represented
by the four corners of the design.
At the top of the shield is a braid of
sweet-grass and a small buckskin bag
containing medicines of a supposed
charm-value. Before going into battle,
some of this sweet-grass was to be
burnt, and ritualistic songs pertaining
to the shield were to be sung. This
having been done, the shield was supposed
to protect its owner from his enemies.
Eight feathers, arranged in pairs,
are attached to the shield, and their quills
are painted to correspond to the parts of the background to which they are
attached.</p>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Fig. 2. Shield-design,<br/> from a Drawing by a Native.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>There is one interesting feature connected with this shield-design, and
that is the fact that some of the old men disapproved of the owner placing
the spider-web design upon the tail of the bird, because it was a mixing of
supernatural manifestations. The incident connected with this design was
regarded by them as most extraordinary, and as having been worthy of
distinct and separate representation. According to the accepted modes
of interpretation, this experience should have been represented upon a new
shield.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The specimen shown in <a href='#plate6'>Plate <span class='sc'>vi</span></a> is not a shield-cover, but was nevertheless
spoken of as a shield; and the design upon it is an old shield-design.
The specimen is a cape (made of cotton) worn around the shoulders in such
a way that the design could be seen upon the back of the wearer. Here
are represented the rainbow, the thunder-bird (possessing in this case
characteristics which indicate that it was copied from the national emblem
of the United States), the new and full moon, and the stars. It will be
observed that the stars in this
case are four-pointed, similar to
the design of the spider-web,
and they are regarded by the
Indians as an example of the
old original method of representing
them.</p>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Fig. 3. Drawing, by a Native, of a Shield-cover.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>As a great many Indians who
formerly owned shields do not
now possess shield-covers, the
writer secured drawings made
by them of their former shields.
Such a sketch is reproduced in
outline (Fig. 2). In the centre
is a design of the spider-web filled in with red. The ground of the shield
is in blue, representing the sky. Above and below are circular areas in
yellow, representing clouds or heaven. Lightning-symbols in red connect
the yellow cloud-symbols with the four corners of the spider-web design.
As a final suggestion relative to this interpretation, the informant said,
“The spider is the friend of the thunder.”</p>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Fig. 4. Shield-design, from a Drawing by a Native.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The manner in which the owner secured the shield-design represented in
Fig. 3 is as follows. Once when a war-party of which he was a member
were about to take the war-path,
it was predicted by an old man
that he would be killed in the
first battle. Before leaving with
the party, he went to an old
medicine-man for help, and this
man made him a shield bearing
the design described below. The
bird represented is the hawk,—flying
from the sky, protected
by the thunder from the hailstones
that fly thick and fast
about him,—and symbolizes
the manner in which the owner of the shield will pass safely through the
hail of lead from the enemy. Four pairs of hawk-feathers are arranged
symmetrically on the circumference of the shield.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the shield-design in Fig. 4, we find a large circular area in the centre
painted yellow and the surrounding portion red. Around the circumference
of the yellow portion are black spots, representing tufts of short crow-feathers.
Upon the original shield, across the top, there was tied the skin
of a weasel, represented in the drawing by a pictograph of that animal.
Four pairs of feathers are arranged symmetrically on the circumference of
this design.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The design represented by Fig. 5 is rather striking, since an image of the
spider is placed in the centre of the shield
surrounded by a circle of red, through
which the numerous red lines radiate
to the circumference of the design.
These red lines represent the web of
the spider. One end of a string is
tied to the mouth of the spider, with an
eagle-plume at the other end, painted
yellow. Around the circumference of
the design is a wavy blue line, representing
water. The owner of this design
received such a shield when a
young man, and stated that he never
understood why the medicine-man who
made it for him placed the blue line around it, and for that reason he could
not explain its significance.</p>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Fig. 5. Spider-design for a Shield, from a<br/> Drawing by a Native.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The design represented in Fig. 6 was dreamed of by the owner himself,
and in this dream he was presented with a shield bearing a design similar
to the sketch. As he was almost blind, the sketch is very crude. In it
appear again the thunder-bird, the stars, the yellow clouds, the red and
blue lightning, the new moon, and the bear. It was claimed that the
curved double line at the bottom represented both the moon and the lightning;
the former by the colors, the latter by its form. Another interesting
point in this design is the representation of an eagle-feather upon the head
of the bear. This is the conventional way of representing a supernatural
bear as distinguished from a real bear.<a id='r5'/><a href='#f5' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[5]</span></sup></a> The owner of this shield-design
claimed, that, while he did not now and had not for years carried or kept
about him a drawing of the design, he felt it as a kind of magic presence
hovering around him, shielding him from harm. He stated, further, that,
while he knew that other men used the symbols represented in his shield-design
as the signs of particular powers and ideas, he himself had no such
interpretation; for in the dream he saw nothing more than a shield bearing
these designs, and received no instruction or information as to their significance.
Their protecting power to him lay in the peculiar supernatural
presence which he always felt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shield-design in Fig. 7 represents a thunderstorm. At the top,
the clouds are represented in blue. Below this, falling rain is represented
by short irregular lines, and the lightning and thunder by zigzag lines extending
downward from the clouds on a background of clear sky. This
design originated in the same manner as did the preceding; that is, a
finished shield was seen in a dream.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><a href='#plate7'>Plate <span class='sc'>vii</span></a> is the reproduction of a model of a shield made of shrunken
bull-hide covered with buckskin. It was collected by Dr. J. R. Walker. The
design is somewhat similar to the preceding. The upper part is painted
in blue to represent the clouds, and the lower part in bluish-green to represent
the sky. In the cloud-area is the drawing of a horse, symbolizing
a dream-horse (probably the thunder-horse). The thunder, or power, is
symbolized by red zigzag lines extending downward from the cloud-area.
An eagle-feather and twelve hawk-feathers are tied to a small buckskin
bag of medicine, fastened to the shield in a manner suggesting their attachment
to the mane of the horse. The circumference of the shield is decorated
with small feathers, and four pairs of eagle-feathers are also arranged
symmetrically around the circumference.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A shield (Fig. 8) similar to the preceding represents a vision in which
the dreamer was apparently supported by the thunder-horse in a contest
with the mythical turtle. A small bag of medicine and a pendant eagle-plume
are attached to the shield, as in the previous case. Feathers are
again arranged in four pairs. This specimen was collected by Dr. J. R.
Walker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Museum collection from the Sauk and Fox Indians, made by
Dr. William Jones, is a shield captured from the Sioux, at the time of the
outbreak of 1866, by a Fox in the employ of the United States Government.
The design was painted upon the rawhide, but is now almost obliterated.
Fig. 9 is a diagrammatic restoration. The writer saw an old
buffalo-hide shield in the possession of an Assiniboine, at Fort Belknap,
Montana. The design was painted upon buffalo-hide, and was similar to
that in Fig. 9. He collected also from the Dakota a number of drawings
representing military exploits. While twenty
shields are represented in these drawings,
fourteen of them bear simple circular designs,
as shown in the adjoining figure.
This suggests that the older type of shield-decoration
made use of simple circular
designs. This idea was supported by the
testimony of a number of old men who
ought to be competent to speak upon the
subject. Of course, there is no reason why
the image of the thunder-bird, so common
upon modern shield-designs, should not have
been used in ancient times; and the writer
wishes to be understood as expressing this as an opinion based upon indirect
evidence.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>These circular designs often represented the sun, other heavenly bodies,
or the sky, which suggests that formerly the shield as a whole may have
been considered as a symbol of the sun. The survivors of shield-using
days seemed to have no actual knowledge of any connection between the
shield-form and the sun, but usually expressed it as their opinion that it
represented the sun, and that the feathers represented the sun’s rays. This
may have been suggested by the fact that eagle-feathers were sometimes
arranged in a half-circle to represent the rays of the sun, and that, furthermore,
the rays of the sun were sometimes spoken of as feathers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shield-designs could originate only in dreams and visions, and were
painted by the person experiencing them, who prayed and sang over his
work to give the shield power. Usually but four shields could be made
from a single dream: to make a great number was sacrilege. Among
the Blackfoot, the shield was often accompanied by a ritual composed of
songs and prayers; and they possessed a few shields with such important
rituals that they were distinguished from the others as “medicine-shields.”
There seems to have been a similar condition among the Dakota, for it
was often said that medicine-shields were hung outside the tepees, upon
tripods, and that during the day they were changed from time to time so
as to keep them facing the sun. This practice was observed by a number
of Plains tribes. However, among the Dakota the tripod often gave place
to a single pole.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak' id='ch3'>GHOST-DANCE DESIGNS.</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>About the year 1890 a religious movement, generally known as the
“ghost-dance religion,” infected the Plains Indians. The chief feature of
this religion was the belief in a speedy return of the old time, the buffalo,
and the extermination of the white race. The different tribes had various
ideas of their duties with respect to this new faith, and, with the exception
of the Dakota, they did not manifest direct hostility to the white race.
This warlike people, however, were already greatly dissatisfied with the
treatment they received from the Government and with the difficult conditions
under which they lived. In consequence, they received the ghost-dance
religion as a herald of the good time which, to their minds, was to
be secured only by war with the white race. While a great many of the
conditions in the immediate environment of the Dakota have been given
by various writers as causes for the outbreak, the fact that these Indians
interpreted the new religion as the manifestation of a warlike spirit was
probably due to the fact that they were at heart a warlike people. Their
ideas still run toward military things. As the essential idea of the ghost-dance
religion was a return of the old time, the ceremonies pertaining
thereto made use of the typical objects and ideas of the past. In this, of
course, they were not entirely consistent, since they did not discard the use
of fire-arms, and did not actually resurrect bows, arrows, and shields. Yet,
as a substitute for the protective power of the shield, they introduced garments
bearing protective designs. These garments are generally known
under the name of “ghost-shirts,” and at the time of the outbreak were
spoken of by white people as “bullet-proof shirts.” The following are
descriptions of these garments by eye-witnesses at the time of their first
appearance:—</p>

<div class='blockquoter9'>

<p class='pindent'>“All the men and women made holy shirts and dresses they wear in dance.
The persons dropped in dance would all lie in great dust the dancing make. They
paint the white muslins they made holy dresses and shirts out of with blue across
the back, and alongside of this is a line of yellow paint. They also paint in the front
part of the shirts and dresses. A picture of an eagle is made on the back of all the
shirts and dresses. On the shoulders and on the sleeves they tied eagle-feathers.
They said that the bullets will not go through these shirts and dresses, so they all
have these dresses for war. Their enemies’ weapon will not go through these dresses.
The ghost-dancers all have to wear eagle-feather on head.”<a id='r6'/><a href='#f6' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[6]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think they wore the ghost-shirt or ghost-dress for the first time that day.
I noticed that these were all new, and were worn by about seventy men and forty
women. The wife of a man called Return-from-scout had seen in a vision that her
friends all wore a similar robe, and on reviving from her trance she called the women
together, and they made a great number of the sacred garments. They were of
white cotton cloth. The women’s dress was cut like their ordinary dress, a loose
robe with wide, flowing sleeves, painted blue in the neck, in the shape of a three-cornered
handkerchief, with moon, stars, birds, etc., interspersed with real feathers,
painted on the waist and sleeves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The ghost-shirt for the men was made of the same material—shirts and
leggings painted in red. Some of the leggings were painted in stripes running up
and down, others running around. The shirt was painted blue around the neck,
and the whole garment was fantastically sprinkled with figures of birds, bows and
arrows, sun, moon, and stars, and everything they saw in nature. Down the outside
of the sleeve were rows of feathers tied by the quill-ends and left to fly in the
breeze, and also a row around the neck and up and down outside of the leggings.
I noticed that a number had stuffed birds, squirrel-heads, etc., tied in their long
hair. The faces of all were painted red with a black half-moon on the forehead or
on one cheek.”<a id='r7'/><a href='#f7' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[7]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Fig. 10 (50-3053). Front of a Ghost-dance Garment.<br/> Length, 126 cm.</span> </p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>As is noted by the above, designs on these garments were made by
individuals who had dreams or other unusual experiences similar to those
of the medicine-men; and it would seem from this account that the designs
and objects used in the dance were in every way similar to those employed
before the ghost-dance religion appeared. The writer made the acquaintance
of several individuals who had prepared such garments at the time of
the ghost-dance, and from them he secured reproductions with explanations
as to the significance of the designs. As some time had elapsed since the
ghost-dance religion was at the height of its popularity, it is possible that
the more special features belonging to it were forgotten by these men, and
that they worked into the reproduced garments older and more conservative
ideas. However, the writer is of the opinion, and he took special
pains to investigate as best he could, that whatever may have been lost in
this way made no important changes in either the objective character of
the designs or in the ideas expressed by them. As a matter of fact, the
ghost-dance in some of its milder forms is still observed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some garments secured by the writer are decorated on both front and
back with designs chiefly pictographic. On the front of one (Fig. 10) is
a large triangular space extending downward from the shoulders (one half
of which is in red and the other half in blue), thickly dotted over with white
spots representing hailstones. The red represents the morning; and the
blue, the night. Extending across from side to side is a large arched figure
made up of red, yellow, white, and green bands, representing the rainbow.
Above this are two four-pointed stars, the red for the morning star and the
black for the stars seen in the night. There is a large green star with eight
points on the dividing-line between day and night, concerning which I
secured no satisfactory explanation. At the apex of the triangular space
are small dots of yellow, representing the dawn; and the sun is placed on
each side of the division between day and night. The new moon is represented
by a black crescent. On the morning-side of this design is the picture
of a butterfly; while on the night-side, extending over into the morning,
is a picture of a peculiar figure, which the artist regarded as a spirit-bird
or man-bird, as he expressed it, with the medicine-hoop in his hand. The
other portion of the dress is covered over with small dots in various colors,
representing bullets. There are also pictures of butterflies, stars, and
buffalo-tracks. On one side are two parallel wavy red lines, and on the
other two in green, representing the lightning.</p>

<div class='figright'>
<img src='images/illo-11.jpg' alt='' id='illo-11' style='width:250px;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Fig. 11 (50-3053). Back of Garment<br/> shown in Fig. 10.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>On the other side of this garment, or the back (Fig. 11), is the representation
of a bird, which seems to be mythical rather than realistic. The
background upon which the figure rests is dotted to represent bullets or hail,
as both have the same significance. The lower part of the garment is the
most interesting. Here we have four buffalo-tracks arranged in rectangular
relation to represent buffalo, and a circle or medicine-hoop (half of which
is red and half green) with extending lines of the same colors, representing
the thunder, or its power. The idea of this association of the hoop, or, as
it is sometimes spoken of, the mirror, is that this buffalo escapes bullets,
or perhaps is immortal. Below the sign of the buffalo is a four-pointed
figure, usually known as the spider-web design, representing the heavens;
and below this is the rainbow. Two swallows are represented connected
to the points in the spider-web design by lines, indicating that they enjoy
the protection of this power, making them difficult to hit with bullets or
other missiles.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On another garment (Fig. 12), the triangular area at the top is entirely
in red, covered with white spots representing hail, and bordered with wavy
lines representing the rainbow. This represents the rainbow in the sky.
The dark crescent represents the moon. Below is a large four-pointed
star in black, representing the night, with a line extending over each side,
representing the clouds. The small disk in red represents a bullet; and
the small green crescent, the moon. Below these is the spider-web design,
representing the heavens, over the four corners of which the lightning
appears; but in this case the design is covered with dots representing the
falling of the stars. Near this design we find the butterfly and the buffalo-tracks.
The remaining space on the whole garment is covered with patches
of color, representing the hail. On the opposite side (Fig. 13) are peculiar
triangular designs, the background of which is in red bordered by
straight lines, suggesting the rainbow; while on the red background are
placed the design of the moon and two circles in such relation as to suggest
a face. This design was spoken of as the “moon-face;” but this seems to
have been an after-interpretation, since the artist wished to represent the
medicine-hoop or mirror in the sky. [It seems likely that this is simply
an adaptation of a head-dress used in the elk ceremony.] Below this we
have a combination which appears to be the spider-web design combined
with the figure of a bird, which is said to be the dream-figure, representing
the bird seen on a tree. Below this we have the moon, rainbow, tracks
of the buffalo, stars, butterfly, and a mounted warrior riding through the
hail.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In Fig. 14, the triangular space at the top is similar to that on the preceding
garment, and need not be described here. The body of the dress
is covered with dragon-flies as they appear when flying over water. The
stars represent reflections in the water; and the dashes of color, the hail.
The wavy green lines extending down the full length of the garment represent
the lightning. In this case the red at the top is spoken of as the thunder-cloud.
On the opposite side (Fig. 15), the triangular area with its
tail-like extension represents the rattlesnake. In addition we have tracks of
the buffalo dragon-fly, and butterfly, all associated as in nature. Upon the
sides of this garment are the designs of the lizard, swallow, and turtle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The above detailed statements concerning the designs and their import
do not convey their full significance as it was brought out in discussions
between the writer and the men who made these garments. In the first
place we find on them symbols to be described in another section of this
paper; namely, the spider-web designs and the medicine-hoop. It will be
seen that in most cases the living creatures represented are those that seem
to have power to escape the hailstones, because, as they say, no matter how
severe the hailstorm may be, no one observes their dead or maimed upon
the ground: therefore they assume that these creatures possess some
extraordinary power, or receive the attention of some protective power.
The bird represented does not seem to be the thunder-bird, as is usually
the case in Dakota art, but such species, usually birds of prey, as soar
above the destructive range of the hail. The lizard and the turtle are
spoken of as animals of great power, since they are killed with great difficulty,
from which it follows that they also enjoy the protection of some
power. This we may generalize by saying that the Indian placed upon
these garments representations of living creatures that, according to his
observation and experience, were seldom hit by missiles, or that possessed
great vitality, making it difficult to kill them. Placed on the garments,
they express a prayer, a hope, or an actual realization, on the part of the
wearer, of the protective power by which these creatures are enabled to
survive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The triangular designs at the top of these garments were spoken of as
shields, the idea being that they were in some measure shield-designs, and
performed the same function as did those upon shields in former times.
Mr. Mooney expresses the opinion that the protective designs on garments
used in the ghost-dance religion were not aboriginal with the Indian.</p>

<div class='blockquoter9'>

<p class='pindent'>“The protective idea in connection with the ghost-shirt does not seem to be
aboriginal. The Indian warrior habitually went into battle naked above the waist.
His protecting ‘medicine’ was a feather, a tiny bag of some sacred powder, the
claw of an animal, the head of a bird, or some other small object which could be
readily twisted into his hair or hidden between the covers of his shield, without
attracting attention. Its virtue depended entirely on the ceremony of the consecration,
and not on size or texture. The war-paint had the same magic power of
protection. To cover the body in battle was not in accordance with Indian usage,
which demanded that the warrior should be as free and unincumbered in movement
as possible. The so-called ‘war-shirt’ was worn chiefly in ceremonial dress-parades,
and only rarely on the war-path.”<a id='r8'/><a href='#f8' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[8]</span></sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This statement, however, suggests that Mr. Mooney based his opinion
upon objective evidence, while the opinion expressed by the writer is based
upon subjective evidence. A comparison of the interpretations of shield-designs
and ghost-dress designs seems to leave little opportunity for any
other conclusion than that the protective designs used in the ghost-dance
were essentially the same as those used in former times upon shields and
other objects. The garments may be foreign; but the idea of protective
designs is most certainly not peculiar to the ghost-dance religion, since it
was widely distributed among American tribes, and associated with ceremonial
objects that were in use at least a century before the ghost-dance
religion appeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the writer had no other information at hand than that furnished by
Mr. Mooney in his comprehensive study of the ghost-dance religion, he
would be inclined to regard the whole as the manifestation of aboriginal
religious ideas in response to a single foreign conception; namely, that of
the coming of a messiah and the destruction of the present order of the
world. The way in which the ghost-dance ceremonies were performed,
the ideas expressed in the songs, the things the priests dreamed of, and
the objects used in the ceremonies, are so characteristically Indian, that
no other interpretation seems possible. However, in the present connection
we are concerned with these designs as types of the universal primitive
expression of belief in the presence of a guiding personal agency that looks
into the affairs of men.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak' id='ch4'>THE HOOP.</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The circle, or more properly the hoop, is a very important religious
symbol among the Dakota. One form of it appears in the great hoop-game
described by Louis Meeker,<a id='r9'/><a href='#f9' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[9]</span></sup></a> and later by Dr. J. R. Walker.<a id='r10'/><a href='#f10' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[10]</span></sup></a> This
hoop is usually about two feet in diameter, and notched so as to divide
the circumference into quadrants. While this hoop-game seems to be a
true gambling game, it could be and was sometimes played as part of a
ritualistic ceremony the object of which was to bring the buffalo. It is
interesting to note that this large hoop is similar to the sacred wheel used
by the Arapaho in the sun-dance. At the time of the ghost-dance outbreak
among the Dakota of Pine Ridge Reservation, Mr. Mooney saw
the hoop and the two pairs of sticks used with it carried in the ceremonies
connected with the ghost-dance religion. He states:—</p>

<div class='blockquoter9'>

<p class='pindent'>“It is said that the medicine-man of Big Foot’s band carried such a hoop
with him in their flight from the north, and displayed it in every dance held by
the band until the fatal day of Wounded Knee. A similar hoop was carried and
hung upon the centre tree at the dance at No Water’s camp near Pine Ridge. To
the Indian it symbolizes the revival of the old-time games.”<a id='r11'/><a href='#f11' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[11]</span></sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The last line of the above quotation implies that the hoop was a part
of the paraphernalia used in the ghost-dance ceremonies, because it symbolized
the ancient games. On another page of the same article occurs
the following:—</p>

<div class='blockquoter9'>

<p class='pindent'>“As it was the favorite game with the men in the olden times, a great many
of the songs founded on these trance visions refer to it, and the wheel and sticks
are made by the dreamer, and carried in the dance as they sing.”<a id='r12'/><a href='#f12' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[12]</span></sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It should be remembered, however, that the game was formerly played
to restore the buffalo when they were temporarily absent from their range;
and, as one of the great objects of the ghost-dance religion was the return
of the buffalo as in the olden times, the reason for the use of the hoop in
the ceremonies described by Mooney is apparent. In Mooney’s account,
a number of songs pertaining to the hoop-game are given as sung by the
various tribes practising the ghost-dance religion. Among these is a Dakota
version, as follows:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>A mythical account of the hoop-game is given by Dr. J. R. Walker, which
indicates one of the probable conceptions upon which this religious use
of the hoop rests.<a id='r14'/><a href='#f14' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[14]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>The hoop-symbol occurs in graphic form, sometimes upon garments.
The writer secured a shirt that was used by one of the leaders in ghost-dances;
and which seems to have been a type of the
so-called “bullet-proof shirt.” This garment is
daubed with red about the neck and on the shoulders,
but in addition bears four circular designs, also
in red, with large dots at their centres (Fig. 16).
One of these designs is placed upon the right breast;
another, directly opposite, upon the back of the garment;
one upon the right shoulder; and one upon the left. These are so
arranged, that, no matter from what point you see the wearer, one of the
circular designs will be visible. These designs were recognized as symbols of
the medicine-hoop, and were supposed to have the power to protect the wearer
from all harm. The idea of placing the designs so that one of them should
always be between the wearer and the source of danger may be original
with the owner of this shirt; but the number of them (four), and their
arrangement according to the four directions, correspond to the common
explanation of religious symbols.</p>

<div class='figleft'>
<img src='images/illo-16.jpg' alt='' id='illo-16' style='width:150px;height:auto;'/>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Meeker describes<a id='r15'/><a href='#f15' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[15]</span></sup></a> a wheel-shaped hoop-ornament consisting of a ring
enclosing four spokes at right angles to each other. According to his account,
this is a symbol associated with the hoop-game; but similar specimens
were seen by the writer upon the heads of Dakota men, who
explained that these were symbols of the medicine-wheel or medicine-hoop,
and did not refer to the hoop-game. They were worn because they
were regarded as symbols of the power that could protect the wearer from
arrows, bullets, or other dangers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As is suggested by the above, the game-hoop is distinguished from the
medicine-hoop as used in ceremonies. A medicine-hoop seems to have
been used by all divisions of the Dakota, and, according to the descriptions
received by the writer, to have been of
several forms. In certain ceremonies
where the elk played an important part,
a hoop or ring was formed by twining
together fresh twigs and leaves of the
willow. In the centre of this hoop, a
small mirror was held by four cords arranged
at right angles, and representing
the four directions. A drawing of an elk-dancer
by a native is shown in Fig. 17.
The painted centre for the circular designs
on a shirt (Fig. 16) described above,
as well as the small wheel-shaped head-ornament,
were said to represent a hoop
of this type.</p>

<div class='figleft'>

<p class='caption'> <span style='font-size:smaller'>Fig. 17. Sketch, by a Native,<br/> of an Elk-mystery Dancer carrying a<br/> Hoop with a Mirror in the Centre.<br/> Drawing collected by R. Cronau.</span> </p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The connection of this hoop with the
idea of protection is well illustrated in
the manufacture of one kind of red paint.
It is produced by burning a kind of yellow
clay, found near the Black Hills,
until it takes on the red color. The
paint, however, is given its protective
power by certain ceremonies performed
as it is made. In the particular ceremony
observed by the writer, the yellow
earth was pounded fine, and mixed with
water until it became a stiff paste. This
was then made into a flat disk about half an inch thick and from four to
six inches in diameter, after which a hole or depression was made in the
centre. The purpose of this, as explained, was to give it the form of a
medicine-hoop, the hole in the centre corresponding to the place occupied
by the mirror in the form of hoop just described. This disk was then
burned in the fire until red, after which it was pounded on a stone until
fine enough for use. The ceremony in preparing the paint consisted of
ritualistic songs and prayers, which reached their climax as the disk of clay
was formed and perforated. The burning and the subsequent preparation
were not regarded as parts of the ceremony. The idea, as expressed, was
to connect the paint with the power represented by the hoop, so that when
a warrior rubbed some of it upon his body, he came at once under the
protection of this power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another idea seems to be connected with the conception of the medicine-hoop,
and that is the appearance of certain mythical animals with openings
through their bodies where their hearts should be. The conception seems
to be, that an animal without a heart is immortal and supernatural: at
least, this is the way in which the mythical elk was described. According
to the belief, there is a connection between this opening through the heart
and the centre of the medicine-hoop, represented in the elk ceremonies by
the mirror; but it is the opinion of the writer that this is an error on the
part of the Indians themselves in associating two things that were formerly
distinct.<a id='r16'/><a href='#f16' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[16]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>It seems rather curious that the mirror should become so closely associated
with the hoop, and that the mirror should have appealed to them
as a symbol of almost equal importance. The writer is of the opinion that
the preceding cases, where the mirror and the hoop are considered as identical
symbols, are the result of a former close association of the two in ceremonial
affairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Report of the Peabody Museum (Vol. III, p. 286) is a description by Miss Fletcher
of some ceremonies in which the hoop and the mirror played a part. “The neophyte held one,
having a circular mirror, fastened by four cords, from which he cast a reflection of the sun from
time to time upon the ground, or held up the hoop, and flashed the mirror.” The explanation
given by this author of the significance of the mirror in these ceremonies differs from that
secured by the writer; but Miss Fletcher’s account seems to refer to a form of ceremony pertaining

<p class='pindent'>In another place the writer has described the conception of the power
of the whirlwind among some of the Dakota, but wishes at this time to
refer to it again because of its relation to their system of protective designs.<a id='r17'/><a href='#f17' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[17]</span></sup></a>
As stated in the former publication, there seems to be in the minds of some
of the Dakota an association between the phenomenon of the whirlwind
and those mental states generally known as “confusion of mind.” Some
of them believed and still believe that the power in the whirlwind can be
invoked to confuse the mind of an enemy. In common with many other
American tribes, the Dakota believe the whirlwind to be associated with
the fluttering wings of a moth, but they also associate this with the cocoon
of the same moth; and in symbolic representation the design representing
the power of the whirlwind is of an elongated diamond-shape, and refers
to the cocoon. The protection or aid of the whirlwind was secured by
prayers, and these prayers were symbolized by the cocoon worn upon the
person, by its image in stuffed buckskin, or by its graphic representation,
sketched or painted. The power of the whirlwind was supposed to have
been associated with the power of the spider-web. As an illustration of
this, we find engraved upon a German-silver cross (Fig. 18) the spider,
and near it three representations of the whirlwind cocoon. Between the
spider and these three designs is a zigzag line, implying the mystic power
connection of the same. Again, on a forked bone object (Fig. 19), the use
of which is unknown, occur a number of incised designs, among which is
again what seems to be the spider-web, the tracks of a quadruped (probably
the buffalo), and four designs representing the whirlwind cocoon, accompanied
in each case by another design which cannot be determined, but
which resembles the footprints of a person. It is interesting to note that
the German-silver cross also bears the tracks of the buffalo, or some ruminant
animal, in association with the spider. In the absence of direct information,
the writer hesitates to offer any interpretation of the design upon
these specimens, although he feels that they could be interpreted with
reasonable certainty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The design of the whirlwind resembles a feather-design, and no doubt
the two are often confused. The difference seems to be, that, when representing
the whirlwind, half of the design is filled with parallel or crossing
lines; while, when representing feathers, half of the design is filled in with
color (see Fig. 19). The feather-design is more fixed in form than that of
the whirlwind. Fig. 20 is a representation of the latter, from the handle of a
club, where it appears in a series with the spider, lizard, elk, and turtle.
Another form of the same design is repeated in a series on a wooden popgun
(Fig. 21).</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak' id='ch6'>THE THUNDER.</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The thunder is a very important deity among all the Indians of the
Plains, and is usually associated with military exploits. While the Dakota
generally regard the thunder as a bird, usually symbolized by the eagle,
yet they sometimes speak of it as a horse, a man, or a dog. The horse
always appealed to them as a creature of mysterious origin, and in many
cases was assumed to have been given by the thunder. In any event there
is an association in their minds between the power of a war-horse and the
thunder. The thunder is often represented by a zigzag or wavy line, usually
in red; but this symbol really represents the power of the phenomenon in
the abstract, because the Indian does have the conception of a force in
nature. Consequently this graphic symbol is also a general sign for the
presence of mysterious supernatural power. The whistles made from the
leg and wing bones of eagles, and used among the Plains tribes, are generally
employed by the Dakota to symbolize the cry of the eagle as a representative
of the thunder-bird. In battle, or sometimes in stress of great
trial, they are sounded to call up the
power of the thunder to rescue the
unfortunate one. As a rule, a zigzag
line is scratched down the sides
of these whistles. In this connection
it is interesting to note the
following:—</p>

<div class='blockquoter9'>

<p class='pindent'>“Before daylight I set off with five
Indians.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This caused a halt, as we
were surrounded and began to suspect
that the enemy had planned to cut us
off. The Indians put on their war-caps,
uttering some few words which I
could not hear distinctly, and then began
to whistle with a small bone instrument
which they hung around their
necks for that purpose.”<a id='r18'/><a href='#f18' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[18]</span></sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This account (1807) by an acute
observer is interesting, because our
present knowledge enables us to
understand the muttered prayers
and the use of the whistle.</p>

<div class='figright'>
<img src='images/illo-22.jpg' alt='' id='illo-22' style='width:200px;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'> <span style='font-size:smaller'>Fig. 22 (50-3023). Whistle, of Bone.<br/> Length, 19 cm.</span> </p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The whistle shown in Fig. 22 is
interesting because of the objects
that accompany it. The whistle is
from the wing-bone of an eagle, and
near the top is a small bag containing
the medicine of the owner.
The feathers of the yellow-winged
woodpecker are attached thereto,
because this bird is considered as
an associate of the thunder-bird,
or at least it holds some relation
to the thunder, since the Dakota
have observed, that, when a storm is approaching, this bird gives a peculiar
shrill call not unlike the sound of the whistle spoken of above. This they
interpret as speaking to the thunder. Consequently, the feathers of this bird,
when attached to the whistle, are supposed to put the individual also in a
position to speak to the thunder. This bird has a large dark spot on the
throat, which is said to represent the moon and to be further evidence of
the sacred character of the bird. Thus we have a combined charm representing
the woodpecker and the eagle,—two birds closely associated with
the thunder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ceremony of offering a filled pipe to the thunder was frequently
observed by the Dakota. One man stated that once, when the camp was
threatened by an approaching storm, he filled a large pipe, went to the top
of a hill, and, facing the storm, made an offering to the thunder by extending
the stem upward, and praying, with the result that the storm divided, and
passed around the camp without serious damage to his people. In the
decoration of pipe-stems, a bunch of horsehair is attached (usually colored
red), and this is often spoken of as an emblem of the thunder-horse. This
horsehair is to signify the presence of the power of the thunder, as manifest
in the horse, in all ceremonies connected with the pipe. It is worth
while noting that in this case we have an illustration of a peculiarity of
religious lore,—the indirect symbolizing of a power by one of a series of
objects in which that power is manifest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The United States emblem of the eagle with outstretched claws, holding
arrows and the lightning, is regarded by the Dakota as an appeal on our
part to the thunder-bird; and statements to the contrary are usually interpreted
as white men’s lies to deceive the Indians and to guard the power.
There is little doubt that the Dakota manner of drawing the thunder-bird
has been modified by the United States emblem, and that their own idea
of his power has been influenced accordingly.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak' id='ch7'>THE SPIDER.</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The association between the spider, the spider-web, and the thunder,
is very close—so close, that it is difficult to understand the conception of
the power of the spider without considering the power of the thunder. The
spider is often spoken of as the “spider-man.” It is also associated with
the mythical elk. It was supposed to have great power. The observed
fact that a spider manufactures a web, and that this web is not destroyed
by bullets or arrows (since they pass through it, leaving only a hole), is
cited by some individuals as the basis for the conception that the spider
has power to protect people from harm. On the other hand, the spider is
spoken of as a friend of the thunder; and it is a general belief that the
thunder will never harm the spider-web, or, what amounts to the same,
that the spider-web itself is a protection against thunder. As previously
stated, the spider-web is represented by a peculiar four-cornered design.
This design is sometimes said to represent the heavens, in which case the
four points represent the four directions, the home of the winds, the four
thunders, etc.; the supernatural character of the design being indicated by
lightning-symbols extending from the four corners.</p>

<div class='figright'>
<img src='images/illo-23.jpg' alt='' id='illo-23' style='width:200px;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Fig. 23 (50-3095). Design of a Spider-web.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>In a preceding paper,<a id='r19'/><a href='#f19' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[19]</span></sup></a> the spider-web design was discussed in its relation
to decorative art, where it was noted that among some divisions of the
Dakota is a belief in a double woman,<a id='r20'/><a href='#f20' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[20]</span></sup></a> to whom, among other things, certain
ceremonial uses of this design are attributed. According to information
secured by the writer, this character was also associated with the elk
ceremonies, where she was often represented by two women tied together by
a cord (about two feet in length), from the middle of which hung a doll or
a ball. Women often receive power by dreaming of this character. Some
such women are supposed to perform a kind of ceremony, somewhat secret,
in which a child is taken out to a lonely place, where a swing or hammock-like
structure is made in the form of the spider-web design, supported by
the four corners, and the child is placed upon it. This is to bring good
fortune to the child. A design of the spider-web might then be placed
upon the robe of the child as a symbol of its having experienced the ceremony
(Fig. 23).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men, however, use this design for military protection, in which
connection it is not thought of as being associated in any way with the
mythical double woman. It is, however, closely associated with the medicine-bow.
This was a very sacred military object with the Dakota, of
which only four duplicates could be had. It consisted of a bow of plain
wood, of the usual length, to the end of which was attached a spear-head.
Fastened to the bow was a stick somewhat longer, sharpened at one end,
and decorated with feathers and other symbolic objects. The purpose of the
stick was to support the bow, since all such sacred objects would lose their
power if allowed to touch the ground. The bow was not used as a weapon,
but was carried as a standard, because of its supposed magical power over
the enemy. The figure of the dragon-fly was usually painted upon the bow
and its support, as well as dots representing insects that fly swiftly, and
zigzag lines representing thunder. Feathers of the eagle, the magpie,
the hawk, and, in fact, of all birds swift of wing, were likewise attached to
it. The association between these insects and birds was the same as that
previously noted; that is, since they were swift in motion, and difficult
to strike, they represented the qualities desired by the bearers of the bow.
These bows have long since passed out of existence, but survive in models
made for commercial purposes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The account of the origin of the medicine-bow is as follows:—</p>

<div class='blockquoter9'>

<p class='pindent'>“A man dreamed of the thunder, and afterwards called in four men to assist
him in making the medicine-bow. They went through the preliminaries (the
sweat-house, etc.), after which a special tent was erected. The ground inside of
this tent, where the dreamer and his four companions sat, was covered with sage-grass.
A young man was called in to act as their assistant. He was sent out to
cut elm sticks. He went out slowly, and after a time came back with the sticks.
Then he was sent out to get together the feathers of swift flying birds, pieces of
buffalo-hide, paints, etc. He went around the camp, and begged these of the people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then the four men set to work making the sticks under the direction of the
dreamer. The dreamer gave a bow to one of the men, and a piece of buffalo-hide
in which to wrap the sticks, also a wooden bowl from which to eat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After a time, the faces of the men were painted red. When the sticks were
finished, four men came in wrapped in buffalo-robes, each carrying a drum. Now
the four men who had prepared the sticks were ready to receive the bow, and the
drummers began to drum and sing. Then the man who dreamed about the bow
carried it outside of the lodge, pointing it toward the west. He was followed by
the whole company, and, after singing a song, they took a step forward and pointed
the bow to the north; another step again, then pointed to the east; and then a
step forward, pointing to the south. Then they ran toward the west, then toward
the east, then toward the north, and then toward the south. [The significance of
this is, that the thunder resides in the four directions of the heavens, and also goes
in all directions, so that the carrying of the sticks toward the various points of the
compass puts them in touch with the thunder.] Then they went back to the sweat-house,
and the ceremony was complete.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The man who owns one of these bows must not wear iron on his person, he
must never give his food to any one else after eating from it himself, and he must
never allow the bow, or any part of it, to touch the ground.”<a id='r21'/><a href='#f21' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[21]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='caption'> <span style='font-size:smaller'>Fig. 24. Sketch of a Robe for the<br/> Medicine-bow Owner. Drawn by a Native.</span> </p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The owner of a medicine-bow should have a buffalo-robe with special
decorations, consisting of a spider-web design of the character previously
described, from the corners of which extend
wavy lines representing the thunder.
Sometimes the picture of a thunder-bird
was drawn above the spider-web design,
or a few tail-feathers of the eagle were
attached to the robe. The spider-web
design on the robe of an owner of a
medicine-bow was to symbolize the
thunder, for, as stated by the informants,
the spider is a friend of the medicine-bow.
None of these robes are now
in existence; but sketches were made for
the writer, one of which is reproduced in
Fig. 24.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The body-painting for the medicine-bow
was rather elaborate. In the first
place, the whole body was smeared over
with a brownish-red paint, representing
the earth in a buffalo-wallow. There
were two ways of decorating the face.
In one, a curved line was drawn, extending
from the corners of the mouth around
over the forehead, the ends of the lines being forked to represent lightning.
Wavy lines, also with forked ends, were drawn down the arms and the legs.
These lines were in black or blue. Blue bands were painted around the
ankles, arms, wrists, and shoulders, representing the power of the lightning.
These bands were often covered with wristlets and anklets of rabbit-fur,
because the rabbit was in some way associated with the medicine-bow. In
the other painting, a crescent, representing the moon, was placed upon the
forehead and a line drawn from ear to ear across the bridge of the nose.
In this form, the body-painting was the same as in the preceding, except
that one of the lines upon the leg was straight instead of wavy, and it was
said to signify the desire for ability to think straight or to possess presence
of mind, in contrast to the state of mind supposed to be produced by the
power of the whirlwind.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The spider-web design has been mentioned in connection with shield
and other designs, and a retrospect indicates a peculiar graphic resemblance
in it to the older type of star-designs shown in <a href='#plate6'>Plate <span class='sc'>vi</span></a>. The writer
uses the term “older” on the authority of two Indians. Some incised
designs on metal ornaments worn by a woman, of the form shown in
Fig. 25, seem to be a combination of the older star-design and that of the
spider-web. Another design (Fig. 26) scratched on the bowl of a straight
pipe of red stone was also said to represent the spider-web. There is
another design used by the Dakota in ceremonies relating to the buffalo;
but it is rectangular in form with projecting corners, and is considered a
distinct symbol.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak' id='ch8'>CONCLUSION.</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The first point that appears in the consideration of these designs and
their interpretations is the animistic basis upon which they rest. The
Indian has observed nature, and singled out those qualities and situations
that are not only wonderful from his point of view, but greatly to be desired
as means to his own ends. He then proceeds on the assumption that these
originate in and are due to some hidden agency, from which it follows,
that, if he can put himself in the place of one of the favored living creatures,
he will in turn be the object upon which this hidden agency will act. If
he can be the bird that rides the storm in safety, he will in turn ride successfully
the analogous storms of his own sphere, and, like the child that
in its own mind is the policeman when it thrusts a club into its waistband,
he feels that he is the bird calling to the thunder when he sounds the bone
whistle, and mutters his song-prayer. That this is true only of the great
Indian or the devotee, speaking in relative terms, and that the mass of
Indian-kind follow in blind imitation of the more sensitive few, may be
true; but the phenomena, for all that, are none the less ethnic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One characteristic of the foregoing protective designs is, that they are
usually animal motives to the almost entire exclusion of plant and inanimate
forms. While it is true that the phenomena of the heavens hold a
prominent place in this art, such phenomena are often interpreted as results
of the activity of animal-like beings, and consequently are so expressed in
art. The conditions leading to such a result are doubtless many and intricate;
but the tendency to ignore plant-forms in protective conceptions may
be due to the inactive character of the more inanimate world. Inert things
are not easily conceived of as guardians or protectors. On the other hand,
the Indian may not see the logical necessity of carrying his view to the
utmost bounds of the universe. Pots and kettles may have an animistic
presence within themselves; but perhaps this does not appeal to the Indian,
because the living creatures are so much nearer to him and the analogy
between their lives and his is not difficult to perceive. The mystery in the
animal forms that come and go, in the storm, and in the heavenly bodies,
reaches the mind unaided; but the plant and mineral wonders require a
more microscopic eye. That there was a time when the animals were as
the people is the striking thought in many Indian myths, and this indicates
a belief in the fundamental life-identity of all moving creatures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is, however, one interesting suggestion in the interpretation of
protective powers. In all of these conceptions we find less appeal for the
direct destruction of enemies than for a shielding protection to enable the
man himself to be the destructive agent. His prayers are, that he may be
swift and impossible to hit in order that he may strike down the victim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again, there are in every part of the preceding paper examples of the
close association between powers, or at least power-symbols, that are from
many points of view incongruous; as the mirror and the hoop, the spider,
the thunder, and the elk. There is in these a tendency to coalesce into
conceptions of larger wholes in which the power becomes more general,
tending toward the definite abstraction of a power-unit, or identity of
forces in nature. These larger conceptions, that are really much more
complex than indicated in this brief paper, seem to represent a growth, or
at least an accumulation of ideas, on the part of a people who have not
felt the need of systematically unifying them, or expressing them as an
objective unit.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
